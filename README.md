Hey! I'm Adhithyan 👨‍💻

I’m an ECE undergrad who loves working on digital circuits, embedded systems, and Verilog-based hardware design.

I enjoy:

Designing hardware modules from scratch

Simulating and improving timing

Linking theory with actual digital implementation

Learning industry workflows (APB, SPI, AXI, UVM, Synthesis, etc.)

Right now, I'm building multiple communication protocol IP cores and exploring FPGA-based digital systems.
